Agent,Customer
hello good afternoon so,rendle
sir my name is amiss and i am your support coordinator with the resources and we wanted to check two things about your business with you if it is the right time sir,yes we're speaking
okay sorry but actually i want to,uh yeah yeah it's one thing i think there's no issue with that there's a base
ask for some questions related to your business,yeah
yes sir actually i have noticed a decline in your business transactions with regard to over the past month i would like to confirm,yeah
yes i would like to something,yes yes yes
oh,because we we are involved you know in a in a specific tourism related business you know like flying business we are involved with paragliding okay
okay some,so uh i just started it last year before that we were with pay
okay sir so as you said it is the business long period so what are your peak months,pay then somehow the you know pay you got resolved and also that was also working but now i'm planning to shift it entirely to raise your pay itself
okay sir i understand sir as you said you are sir you are totally shifting to the razor pay sir we look forward to giving you the best experience on razor pay itself sir we believe that utilizing our service for your entire payment facilitation process,because i find the platform is much better you know than uh e u
would be ideal and would also simply require account reconciliation,the next part is that we we are a seasonal business okay so most probably by october fifteenth we generally close actually it doesn't fly in the winters
thank you so much,then it again starts in myanmar sepulchre so so we take you know payments on site payments and also it's used there
as i understand,ah i think peak months are maybe around may june july that's the peak you know in
he said finish,yes yes yes
yes provide you the better experience on days of itself so that you don't need to ship anywhere,exactly that it will be greatly simplifying right now you know looking after two accounts you know looking out here in pay you also in razor also then it becomes a lot of accounting difficulties so but basically i'm planning to shift it out entirely to you know pay ya sorry raiser pay itself
yes right,so not an issue at all and that's
there is one more question as you accept the payments you currently are accepting and through what is your u p i share,because i find that your settlement time period you know payments you know it's all
yes i'm,all very clear transfer and on time the reason why i come to pay was because you know pay you money used to you know deduct uh you know money from the clients and then you know the transfer period to our accounts is extremely high you know and uh you have to go back several months you know raising you know
ok so listen,business queries and all making complaints and to get your own money back that was a very painful exercise so now i think it's all very simplified in research preferring that actually right now
okay sir,it's a good news for yourself
mm yes i understand so,for reservation
so is there anything else i can help you with sir,yes yes yes sure sure sure
i'll be sorry,thank you and thank you
