# LangChain_NLP

**Project Overview:**

This project involves the development of a customer support chatbot implemented in Python. The chatbot facilitates interactions between customers and support agents using a conversation transcript as training data. The key components of the project include:

1. **Conversation Transcript:**
   - The chatbot is trained on a conversation transcript between a customer and a support agent. This dataset captures real-world interactions to enhance the chatbot's understanding and responsiveness.

2. **LangChain Framework:**
   - LangChain, a powerful framework, is employed for building the chatbot model. It enables the creation of conversational agents by providing a structured approach to handle dialogues.

3. **Palm Model (Language Model):**
   - The project incorporates a Language Model (LLM) known as Palm. Palm is a variant of GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) designed for natural language processing tasks. It enhances the chatbot's ability to generate contextually relevant responses.

4. **OpenAI Embedder:**
   - OpenAI's Embedder is utilized for embedding text data. This embedding process converts textual information into numerical vectors, facilitating efficient storage and retrieval.

5. **Faiss Vector Database:**
   - Faiss, a vector database, is employed to store and retrieve embeddings based on cosine similarity. This enables quick and accurate retrieval of relevant information during user interactions.

6. **GitHub Repository:**
   - The project code and related files are organized in a GitHub repository. The repository includes the implementation code, dataset, and documentation for a seamless understanding of the project structure and functionality.

**How to Use:**

To run the chatbot and explore its capabilities:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt` file.
3. Follow the instructions in the documentation to set up and run the chatbot.
